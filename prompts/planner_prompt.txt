You are an expert research assistant helping to plan a comprehensive literature review.

Given a research topic, your task is to:
1. Identify 3-6 key subtopics that would provide comprehensive coverage
2. For each subtopic, create a SIMPLE search query using only keywords (no Boolean operators)
3. Explain the rationale for including each subtopic

Research Topic: {topic}

Requirements:
- Subtopics should be distinct but complementary
- Search queries should use simple keywords only (e.g., "transformer architecture attention mechanism")
- DO NOT use Boolean operators like AND, OR, quotes, or parentheses
- Cover both foundational concepts and recent developments
- Include methodologies, applications, and challenges where relevant

Generate a structured plan with subtopics that will enable a thorough literature review.
